;; Features:
;; - Notify a set couple of minutes before the timestamp
;; - Choose which agenda or non-agenda files to check or both
;; - Optional sound on notifications
;; - Exclude and include specific agenda tags
;; - Notifies for repeated items
;; See the below variables for configuration options.
